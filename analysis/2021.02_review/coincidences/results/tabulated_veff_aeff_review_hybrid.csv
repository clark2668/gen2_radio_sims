NB (!!): The overlap fraction is the fraction of events which overlap between the shallow and deep detectors when they are deployed at a ratio of 1:1.9
This is reasonably close to the 1:1.17 ratio in the review array, but is not exact.
So, to get the total array effective volume, you should do ((n_deep * deep_veff) + (n_shallow * shallow_veff))*(1-overlap_fraction)
But you should not trust that formula for n_deep == n_shallow, because that is NOT what was simulated. It needs to be ~1:1.1
